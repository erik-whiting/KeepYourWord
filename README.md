# KeepYourWord
CMS application with a Microsoft Word backend

This project is being completed as part of SWEN 5236 at University of Houston Clear Lake during Spring 2019 semester.
The project requires the completion of up to five features.  The features I've documented are as follows:
* ~~Ability to render web content from MS Word document~~
* ~~Ability to create a website structure from folder paths~~
* ~~Feature where writers/contributors can submit articles for approval~~
* ~~Approval and rejection feature for blog editors or website owners~~
* Customization of blog/website styles (Won't Do)

## Final Update
KYW Has been turned in and no code will be changed until 3/25 when the class officially ends.
